              Yes, it is! A babysitter is someone who comes to your home to take care of your child. A childminder, on the other hand, takes care of your child in their own home. So, you can choose which option suits you best. And, of course, you can always use a babysitter for a night out, or for a day when you have to work. But, you can also use a babysitter when you want to go to the gym, or when you have an appointment. Or, when you just need some time for yourself. Itâ€™s all possible!
